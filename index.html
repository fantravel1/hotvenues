A score above 85 means volcanic."

The <a href="coming-soon.html">Right Now</a> list highlights venues at their absolute peak this year — from Berlin's underground techno rooms to Lagos's Afrobeats warehouses to Tokyo's all-night dance temples.</p>

                            <p>HotVenues separates heat from hype. A venue can be legendary and cold — coasting on reputation while the floor stays half-empty. Truly hot clubs score high on Dance Density and Crowd Commitment: real bodies moving together, sweat not selfies, strangers dancing like they belong. The <a href="coming-soon.html">HOT Index</a> ignores fame, brand partnerships, and influencer traffic. Only current, measurable heat matters.</p>

A door score of 8+ means strict selection; 3 or below means walk-in friendly. Tourist Friendliness tells you whether the venue welcomes newcomers or caters to locals and regulars.</p>
